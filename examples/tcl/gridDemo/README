Abstract
--------

      This demo shows how to use the java::* commands to create GUI
      components and handle user events. It also shows how a grid
      like command can be constructed around a GridBagLayoutManager.

Why Bother?
-----------

      The java::* commands can be used to do rapid development of AWT-
      based GUI applications.  Forget all the fuss of implementing
      event interfaces, using inner classes, etc., to handle
      events.  Just use the java::bind command!

Running The Demo
----------------
Run:
>gridDemo.tcl 

     Now you can select the employees to fire by selecting their
     names and clicking on the arrow buttons.
