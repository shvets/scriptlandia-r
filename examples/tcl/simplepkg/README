Abstract
--------

      This demo shows how to write a simple Tcl extension in Java.  
      The SimpleExtension contains one Tcl command, "sayhello",
      which returns the string "Hello World!" when invoked.

Running the Demo
----------------

     To see the demo in action start out by typing "make demos" in the
     directory you compiled in. This will create a demos subdirectory
     in the directory you compiled in. At this point you will want to
     start up a java enabled shell. The easiest way to do this is to
     type "make shell" and then cd to the demos/simplepkg directory
     that was created inside the directory you compiled in. At this
     point you can load the extension like this "source simple.tcl".
     You should see a "hello world" message that shows the extension
     was loaded and is functioning properly.
