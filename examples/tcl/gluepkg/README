Abstract
--------

     This demo shows how to write commands that glue together
     existing Java applications.

Why Bother?
-----------

     In time, many applications require more functionality than 
     was originally provided.  If a feature has already been 
     implemented in a different application, you can use scripting 
     to glue the existing feature to your new application.  

     Suppose FileDialogApp and ListboxApp are existing Java applications.
     FileDialogCmd and ListboxCmd provide an interface between Tcl
     and the existing applications.  JarCmd is another example of how to 
     write new Tcl commands in Java (see simplepkg for an very simple
     example of how this is done.)  The GlueExtension class is the
     device that dynamically loads all of the new Tcl commands into
     the Interpreter.

Running The Demo
----------------
>glue.tcl 

     A file dialog menu will pop
     up, select a valid jar file and press OK.  This window will
     disappear and another window will be displayed.  The new window
     contains a listing of all of the files in the selected jar file.
     By selecting one or more of the files and pressing OK, the
     selected files will be extracted from the jar file and displayed
     to stdout.
