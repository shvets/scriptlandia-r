Abstract

	This directory contains demos that show various ways to
	program with Jacl and Tcl Blend.

Demos
-----

1) simplepkg:   Shows how to write a simple Tcl extension package in
                Java.

2) gluepkg:     Shows how to write Tcl commands that glue together
                existing Java applications.

3) watchpkg:    Shows how to extend Tcl with a Java class by writing
                code in either Tcl or in Java.

4) pyramidpkg:  Shows how to embed a Tcl console inside a Java applet.
 		Note: This demo is only available for Jacl.  In

5) gridDemo:	Shows how to use the java::* commands to create GUI

                GridBagComponent can be wrapped inside a "grid"
                like command.

6) packDemo:	This demo shows how the java::* commands can be used
                to create a layout manager for java widgets that acts
                just like the pack command from tk.
